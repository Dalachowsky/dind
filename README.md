## Dalach Is Not a Developer

Hi if you somehow stumpled upon this repository you might want 
to know what is happening here right?

So basically here i will upload my bash scripts (mainly to
acces them from other PCs) but if you find some of them helpful
feel free to use them.

## DAC 

Dalach's Auto Compiler
v1.2

This script searches for any *.cpp and *.h files inside current
directory, compiles them and links. User can specify the output
file name and if he wants it to be executed afterwards.
